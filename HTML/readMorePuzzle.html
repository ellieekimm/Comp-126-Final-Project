            Cow Puzzle Night was an absolute spectacle! Imagine a moonlit field,
            a gathering of curious cows, and an array of puzzles specially
            designed for their inquisitive minds. We set up a variety of
            challenges, from tactile puzzles to food-dispensing toys, and the
            cows took to them with surprising gusto. It was mesmerizing to watch
            them strategize, nudge puzzle pieces, and experiment with different
            approaches. It was an unforgettable night, and judging by their
            enthusiasm, the cows thoroughly enjoyed exercising their minds.
