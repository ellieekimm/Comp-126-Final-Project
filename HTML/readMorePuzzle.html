Imagine a moonlit field, a gathering of curious cows, and an array of puzzles specially designed for their inquisitive minds. We set up a variety of challenges, from tactile puzzles to food-dispensing toys, and the cows took to them with surprising gusto. It was mesmerizing to watch them strategize, nudge puzzle pieces, and experiment with different approaches. It was an unforgettable night, and judging by their enthusiasm, the cows thoroughly enjoyed exercising their minds.</p>
