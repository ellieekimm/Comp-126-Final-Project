Picture this: a serene pasture, a group of gentle, curious cows lounging around, and our team sharing enchanting tales with them. The atmosphere was serene, with the cows seemingly enchanted by the stories. We chose narratives with soothing rhythms and vibrant descriptions, tailored to capture their attention. What struck us most was their peaceful demeanor throughout the event. We're already planning our next story timeâ€”they seemed to enjoy it as much as we did!</p>
